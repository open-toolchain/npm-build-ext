ARCHIVE_DIR_DESC=After the build job is completed, this directory's contents are archived as the build artifacts.

To exclude files from this directory, create a .csignore file that includes a line-separated list of the files and folders to ignore, similar to a .gitignore file for Git. To refer to this path in the build script, use the ARCHIVE_DIR environment variable.
